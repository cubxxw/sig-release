  text: 'kubeadm: Graduated the kubeadm-specific feature gate `ControlPlaneKubeletLocalMode`
    to GA and locked it to enabled by default. To opt out, patch the `server` field
    in `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf`. Deprecated the subphase of `kubeadm join phase
    control-plane-join` called `etcd`, which is now hidden and replaced by subphase
    with identical functionality `etcd-join`. The `etcd` subphase will be removed
    in a future release. The subphase `kubelet-wait-bootstrap` of `kubeadm join` is
    no longer experimental and will now always run.'
