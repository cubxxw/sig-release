  text: 'Updated `kubectl scale` to return a consistent error message when a specified
    resource is not found. Previously, it returned: `error: no objects passed to scale
    <GroupResource> "<ResourceName>" not found`. It now matches the format used by
    other commands (e.g., `kubectl get`): `Error from server (NotFound): <GroupResource>
    "<ResourceName>" not found`.'
