    "Improved the `FreeDiskSpaceFailed` warning event to provide more actionable
    details when image garbage collection fails to free enough disk space. Example:
    `Insufficient free disk space on the node's image filesystem (95.0% of 10.0 GiB
    used). Failed to free sufficient space by deleting unused images. Consider resizing
    the disk or deleting unused files.`."
