    kubeadm: Graduated the `NodeLocalCRISocket` feature gate to beta and enabed it by default. When its enabled, kubeadm will:
      1. Generate a `/var/lib/kubelet/instance-config.yaml` file to customize the `containerRuntimeEndpoint` field in per-node kubelet configurations.
      2. Remove the `kubeadm.alpha.kubernetes.io/cri-socket` annotation from nodes during upgrade operations.
      3. Remove the `--container-runtime-endpoint` flag from the `/var/lib/kubelet/kubeadm-flags.env` file during upgrades.
